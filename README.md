# Gesture Control System
As a basic computer setup have essential components such as monitor, CPU , keyboard and mouse. But what if we can control our system without using mouse and keyboard? Seems interesting right?

In morden days many PCs and Laptops comes with Touch Screen displays which is quite good.But For now let's go a step further , What about if we can control our display without touching it? Seems awesome right?

We have just tried to make a system that can fingure out coordinate of our finger or say it just track position of our hand and then tracks the cursors location in the screen and matches it. Through this we can create a virtual mouse with we can control system gesture without any physical contact. Let's know how it works and it's components.

## PROJECT OBJECTIVE
In this project we have tried our best to create an interactive control system through which we can replace the use of mouse and touch screen. Still currently this have many limitations but it‚Äôll be improved in further days.

## TECH STACK USED üìö

- [x]  **Python** 
- [x]  **OpenCV**
- [x]  **MediaPipe**
- [x]  **PyAutoGUI**

## HOW IT WORKS? ü§î
The code uses OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI libraries to create a virtual mouse. The program detects hand landmarks using MediaPipe Hands, and then maps the position of the index finger and thumb to the screen coordinates using PyAutoGUI.The index finger is used as a cursor, while the thumb is used as a clicker.
